Production Dashboard - MS Excel Project
📊 Project Overview

This project is a Production Dashboard created using Microsoft Excel.
It provides insights into production costs, tasks by managers, units produced over time, and cost efficiency by product type.

The dashboard was built using:

Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts for summarization.

Slicers for interactive filtering.

Excel functions for calculations and KPIs.

Visualization tools to make production insights clear and actionable.

🚀 Key Features of the Dashboard

Total Product Cost by Product Type

Shows cost distribution across Automobiles, Electronics, Furniture, and Machinery.

Helps identify the most expensive production categories.

Number of Tasks by Manager

Bar chart displaying tasks handled by managers (Sarah Lee, Nancy Grey, Mike Brown, etc.).

Useful for analyzing workload distribution.

Total Units Produced by Year/Month

Line chart representing units produced over time (monthly from 2023–2024).

Identifies production peaks and seasonal variations.

Average Production Cost per Unit by Product Type

Pie chart showing per-unit production cost distribution across product types.

Helps assess efficiency and cost optimization opportunities.

Interactive Filters (Slicers)

Region: East, North, South, West

Gender: Male, Female, Unknown

Age Group: A1, A2, A3

Quarter & Date Range (dynamic time-based filtering)

📌 Key Insights from Dashboard

Automobiles have the highest production cost.

Furniture accounts for the highest share in average production cost per unit.

Sarah Lee manages the maximum number of tasks, followed by John Doe.

Production volume peaked in March 2024 (4177 units).

Slicers make it easy to analyze production data across regions, demographics, and time periods.
